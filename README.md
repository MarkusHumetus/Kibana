# Kibana

Exercises for training Kibana skills from scratch

## Objectives

Exercises to learn and train working with **Kibana**, a practical graphical tool to show relevant info.

## Getting Started

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Kibana/blob/main/S15_T01_Kibana.ipynb) was run in **Python3.7** and next libraries were installed specifically for the use of this tipe of tool:
**pymongo**: driver for DDBB (Motor could be used as alternative)
**dnspython**: to use cloud version
**datetime** for date&time data managing

Take care to change password and name of the DDBB for the connection text adress.

One must be logged in the Elastic service (free trial account for 14 days) and install the **MongoDB Community Server**(version 5.0.9 installed for Windows) which should include MongoDB Comapss.

There is also the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Bases_de_dades_NoSQL/blob/main/requirements.txt) that include all libraries installed in the environment used to run the Jupyter Notebook.
